Secure Password Manager
Description:
Develop a password manager that emphasizes security and user privacy. Unlike traditional password managers that rely on cloud-based solutions, this password manager will store encrypted passwords locally on the user's device. It should use strong encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.

Features:

Local Encryption: All password data should be encrypted locally on the user's device using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).
Password Generation: Provide a tool for generating strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria.
Password Storage: Allow users to store their passwords securely within the application.
Master Password: Implement a master password system for access to the password vault.
Cross-Platform Support: Develop the password manager as a cross-platform application (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Clipboard Management: Provide an option to manage clipboard contents securely to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
Backup and Restore: Allow users to create encrypted backups of their password vault and restore from a backup if needed.
Password Strength Analysis: Evaluate and display the strength of stored passwords, suggesting improvements if necessary.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: Use a framework like Electron.js for building cross-platform desktop applications.
Encryption: Implement strong encryption algorithms, such as AES for data encryption and bcrypt for hashing master passwords.
UI/UX: Design a user-friendly interface for managing passwords.
Version Control: Use Git for version control and host the project on GitHub.
Security Considerations:

Follow best practices for secure coding to minimize vulnerabilities.
Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
Conduct security audits to identify and address potential issues.
Contributions:
Invite contributors to enhance the project by adding features like two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, or integration with hardware security modules.

Documentation:
Include comprehensive documentation on how the encryption process works, security considerations, and how to contribute securely.

Deployment:
Release executable versions for different operating systems and provide installation instructions.

By creating a secure password manager, you contribute to the cybersecurity landscape by promoting good security practices and empowering users to better protect their sensitive information.
